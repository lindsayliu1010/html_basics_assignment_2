            Wyoming is a special place: Where our farmers and ranchers rise
            before dawn and work until night to feed our nation. Where our coal
            miners and oil field workers produce the energy that powers
            America's homes and businesses, and where our families are guided by
            faith, know the value of hard work, and deeply love our land.</em

          After working in big tech for a decade, I want to settle down and have
          a family. I want to work remote in a remote part of Wyoming and have
          kids and a dog. This is where I see myself living out the rest of my
          life

            I chose this quote because my mom, dad, and brother are important to
            me. They have always worried for my safety, health, and education,
            and I am grateful to have a loving family who worry for me. I would
            not have had these opportunities I have today if it weren't for
            their sacrifices. As a first generation immigrant, I want to make my
            parents proud. In order to do so, I want to get a good job after
            college. After spending some time in the workforce, I want to live
            out my dream.
